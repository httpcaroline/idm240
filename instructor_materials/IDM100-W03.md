Regarding your reading assignment, bring with you to class a single sheet of paper. This single piece of paper will have on it three MEANINGFUL questions from the reading assignment, the answer to each question and the page number (or Chapter and subsection Title for eBooks) the information came from. At the top of the page write the assignment title (i.e. Reading Homework Week 1), date of class, your full name, Drexel email prefix. These questions will be used next class for an extra credit game. If you do not meet the listed requirements, you will NOT be eligible to participate and will NOT receive credit for the assignment.
